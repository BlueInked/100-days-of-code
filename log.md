# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 7, 2017 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started Python based RPG script.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with this mostly because I think I made the start too complex for my skill level

**Link to work:** [RPG script](python-pit/rpg-script.py)

### Day 1: January 8, 2017 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS picure slider.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled a part in my JS I cn't figure what I did wrong to make the next button not functionable, but the previous button still works.  My UI needs major work .
